    "### What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a different way of writing code compared to what we've done so far. In previous notebooks, whenever we wanted to perform a calculation, we wrote exactly what we wanted to do by calling functions and assigning results to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, however, functions and variables take a back seat to another type of entity called an **Object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Object is a piece of code that groups together a set of variables and functions into a single entity. In object-oriented programming terminology, the variables contained in an object are called **attributes**, while the functions are called **methods**. Typically, an object-oriented program will include several objects that use their methods to interact with each other and perform tasks. Objects that share the same attributes and methods belong to the same **Class**. Classes are therefore a kind of template for creating objects, defining their attributes and methods. In practice, a program uses objects from different classes to function.\n",

    "- `self` represents the object itself.\n",
    "- `self.name` and `self.age` are attributes. These are the data specific to each object.\n",
    "- `bark()` is a method."

    "### Why use object-oriented programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes allow us to represent real-world things.** Each object can have its own data (attributes) and actions (methods).  \n",
    "   Example: an object `Car` with attributes like `brand` and `speed`, and methods like `brake`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Easily reuse code**: You can create multiple objects from a single class, instead of repeating the same code everywhere.  \n",
    "   Example: `v1 = Car(\"Toyota\", 80)` and `v2 = Car(\"BMW\", 100)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Organize and structure code** by grouping related data (attributes) and functions (methods) together.\n",
